Secre Santa implementation for Django

Meets a few specific requirements:

- people won't be assigned as "Santa" for their immediate family members or themselves
- it is impossible for anyone (even the server admin) to find out who is buying for whom
- is an example of a cleanly implemented Django application

If you find any problems with this (especially concerning the last requriement), please let me know.
